# Research

This directory contains research notes, analysis, and findings.

## Purpose

Document the research process, insights, and decision-making that informs the project design and development.

## Guidelines

- **Date your research**: Include timestamps on notes and findings
- **Cite sources**: Document all references and data sources
- **Track questions**: Keep a running list of open questions and hypotheses
- **Document assumptions**: Make implicit knowledge explicit
- **Record dead ends**: Document what didn't work and why
- **Link to design**: Reference research findings in design decisions

## Organization

Organize research by topic or theme. Consider using:
- Chronological notes (daily logs)
- Thematic analysis (by topic)
- Literature reviews
- Data exploration notebooks
- Competitive analysis

## Research Workflow

1. Document initial questions and goals
2. Record sources and methodology
3. Capture findings and insights
4. Identify implications for design
5. Update design docs with research outcomes
