# Design

This directory contains design specifications, architecture decisions, and system design documents.

## Purpose

Document the "why" and "how" of system design decisions, creating a clear path from research to implementation.

## Guidelines

- **Explain rationale**: Document why decisions were made
- **Consider alternatives**: Record options evaluated and trade-offs
- **Link to research**: Reference research findings that informed decisions
- **Keep current**: Update designs as implementation evolves
- **Be specific**: Provide enough detail for implementation
- **Use diagrams**: Visual representations clarify complex concepts

## Document Types

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Major architectural decisions
- **System Design**: Overall system architecture and components
- **Data Models**: Database schemas and data structures
- **API Specifications**: Endpoint definitions and contracts
- **UI/UX Designs**: User interface mockups and flows
- **Security Design**: Security considerations and measures

## Design Workflow

1. Review research findings
2. Identify design requirements
3. Propose solutions with alternatives
4. Document decision rationale
5. Create specifications for implementation
6. Update as implementation reveals new insights
